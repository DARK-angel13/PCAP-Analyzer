PCAP/PCAPNG Traffic Analysis and Machine Learning-Based Anomaly Detection
Project Overview
This project is designed to analyze network traffic data from PCAP (Packet Capture) and PCAPNG (Next Generation PCAP) files. The analysis includes:
•	Identifying protocol distribution
•	Detecting port scanning activities
•	Tracking network utilization
•	Identifying malicious IP addresses (DDoS and data exfiltration threats)
•	Extracting network performance metrics like latency, jitter, and throughput
•	Training a Machine Learning model for automated anomaly detection
The system leverages Python libraries such as dpkt and pyshark for packet parsing, matplotlib for visualization, and sklearn for building the ML model.

Workflow
1.	File Upload and Type Detection
o	Users upload a PCAP or PCAPNG file.
o	The system detects the file type based on its header.
2.	Packet Analysis and Feature Extraction
o	The file is processed using dpkt for PCAP and pyshark for PCAPNG.
o	Key details such as source/destination IPs, protocols, packet sizes, timestamps, and ports are extracted.
o	The system tracks bandwidth usage per IP and detects DDoS and data exfiltration threats.
3.	Threat and Anomaly Detection
o	Port scanning is identified if an IP contacts more than 10 unique ports.
o	Malicious IPs are flagged based on excessive bandwidth usage or communication frequency.
4.	Network Performance Metrics Calculation
o	Computes latency, jitter, throughput, packet loss, and utilization based on packet timestamps.
5.	Machine Learning Model Training
o	Extracted features are used to train a RandomForestClassifier.
o	If insufficient data is available, the model training is skipped.
o	Accuracy is evaluated on test data.
6.	Visualization and Reporting
o	Generates bar graphs of top bandwidth-consuming IPs.
o	Prints statistics and detected anomalies.

Future Enhancements
1.	Deep Learning-Based Anomaly Detection
o	Implement an LSTM-based approach to identify suspicious patterns over time.
2.	Real-Time Packet Capture and Analysis
o	Extend the project to capture live network traffic using scapy or tshark.
3.	Advanced Threat Intelligence Integration
o	Use external databases (e.g., AbuseIPDB, VirusTotal) to verify suspicious IP addresses.
4.	Web-Based Dashboard
o	Create a user-friendly interface using Flask or Django for interactive analysis and visualization.
5.	Expanded Feature Engineering
o	Extract additional features such as TCP flags, flow duration, and payload entropy for improved ML detection.
By implementing these improvements, the system can evolve into a robust intrusion detection and network forensics tool, aiding security professionals in identifying and mitigating cyber threats effectively.
Machine Learning Model Used in PCAP Analysis
1. Model Selection: Random Forest Classifier
Your project employs a Random Forest Classifier, which is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and combines their outputs to improve accuracy and reduce overfitting.
2. Why Random Forest?
Handles high-dimensional data: PCAP files contain a vast amount of network traffic data, and Random Forest is capable of managing multiple features efficiently.
Resistant to overfitting: By averaging multiple decision trees, the model generalizes well on unseen data.
Fast training and inference: Unlike deep learning models, Random Forest provides quick and effective classification.
Works well with small datasets: Since network intrusion datasets may have imbalanced classes, Random Forest can still perform reliably.
3. ML Workflow in the Project
Feature Extraction:
The model extracts important network parameters such as:
Packet length
Protocol type
Port scanning activity
Bandwidth consumption
Communication patterns
Labeling:
Normal traffic is labeled 0 (benign).
Suspicious traffic, such as port scanning or abnormal data transfer, is labeled 1 (malicious).
Data Preprocessing:
The extracted features are standardized using StandardScaler() to improve model performance.
The dataset is split into 80% training and 20% testing using train_test_split().
Model Training:
A Random Forest Classifier with 100 decision trees (n_estimators=100) is trained on the dataset.
The model learns patterns in network behavior and identifies potential threats.
Prediction & Evaluation:
The model is tested on unseen data to classify normal vs. malicious traffic.
Performance is evaluated using accuracy score.
